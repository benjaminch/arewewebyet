# Are we *web* yet?

**You can build stuff!**

<p>Rust has a mature <a href="/topics/stack/">HTTP stack</a>{% include level.html level=2%} and various <a href="/topics/frameworks/">frameworks</a>{% include level.html level=3 %} enable you to build APIs and backend services quickly. While increasingly more <a href="/topics/database/#drivers">databases drivers</a>{% include level.html level=2 %} become available, <a href="/topics/database/#orms">ORMs</a>{% include level.html level=5 %} and connections to <a href="/topics/services/">external services</a>{% include level.html level=5 %} (like search or worker queues) are still scarce. Looking farther, it doesn't necessarily get better. Though there is significant support for base needs (like <a href="/topics/compression/">data compression</a>{% include level.html level=2 %} or <a href="/topics/logging/">logging</a>{% include level.html level=2 %}), a lot more web-specific needs are still unmet and immature.</p>

## Can I replace my Rails/Django/Flask already?

**Well, probably not yet**. While the basics are there, many of the handy utility libs that make working with many popular frameworks so quick and easy are still missing. **If your service primarily provides an API** to be consumed by  other computers, requires little external services and you are happy with writing most SQL yourself, then **Yes, You Can!** Otherwise, we would not recommend it just yet.

### What should I replace it with?

The web frameworks of choice in the community are:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/topics/frameworks/#pkg-actix-web">Actix</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/topics/frameworks/#pkg-gotham">Gotham</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/topics/frameworks/#pkg-rocket">Rocket</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/topics/frameworks/#pkg-tower-web">Tower Web</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/topics/frameworks/#pkg-warp">Warp</a>
  </li>
</ul>

For data storage there are mature drivers for:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/topics/database/#pkg-mysql">Mysql</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/topics/database/#pkg-postgres">Postgres</a> 
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/topics/database/#pkg-redis">Redis</a>
  </li>
</ul>

If you'd like to use an ORM there is:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/topics/database/#pkg-diesel">Diesel (Postgres / Mysql / Sqlite)</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/topics/database/#pkg-rustorm">Rustorm (Postgres / Sqlite)</a>
  </li>
</ul>

If you need to (or want to) go lower in the stack:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/topics/stack/#pkg-h2">H2</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/topics/stack/#pkg-hyper">Hyper</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/topics/stack/#pkg-tiny_http">tiny_http</a>
  </li>
</ul>
